# Ideas for Myo-arm control when there are still muscle stumps in the arm.

## Pronation:
Sensor 7 only

## Supplination
Sensor 7 & 8?

## Hand clench
Sensor 5,6.

## Hand open
Sensor 1, 6, 7, 8?

## Training

Perhaps we can use a second Myo in the good arm to show the prosthesis what we want the arm to do. It alters the training software to learn new ghost electrical motions.

## Fallback plan for bad muscle cases

For people that have no usable muscles in the stumps, we should fall back to using 2 simple co-contraction sensors on both arms for control.
